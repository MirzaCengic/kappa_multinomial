# This is a brief tutorial for using `kappa_multinomial`, a new way to assess the performance of multinomial predictions for landcover 

Increasingly, land cover models use multinomial models to predict occurence of discrete classes. At present, no suitable mesure exist to evaluate the agreement of such models with observations.

This package provides a method $k_multinomial$ to assess the agreement between multinomial models (i.e. those that predict an occurence probabity for classes of outcomes) and observations which have either discrete outcomes or outcomes represented by frequencies.

We refer to Run_Kappa for examples and application of the above mentioned.
